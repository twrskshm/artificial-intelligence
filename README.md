# Artificial Intelligence Project

This repository is dedicated to the development of various artificial intelligence systems and algorithms from scratch. The project is structured into several key components, focusing on building a comprehensive knowledge base approach and implementing machine learning techniques.

## Project Structure

### `knowledgebase`
This module focuses on the knowledge-based approach to AI, which includes rule-based systems, expert systems, and 
logical reasoning frameworks that utilize domain-specific knowledge to make decisions.

### `machinelearning`
This module contains various submodules related to different machine learning paradigms:

#### `llm` (Large Language Models)
Includes implementations and adaptations of large language models with specifics versions:
- `Meta-Llama-3-70B`: Implementation of a 70B parameter model.
- `Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct`: Instruction-based variant of the 70B model.
- `Meta-Llama-3-8B`: Smaller 8B parameter model version.
- `Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct`: Instruction-based variant of the 8B model.

#### `supervisedlearning`
Focuses on classical supervised learning algorithms:
- `linear-regression`: Module for linear regression implementation.
- `logistic-regression`: Module for logistic regression techniques.
- `neural-networks`: Implements various forms of neural networks.

#### `utilities`
Contains general utility functions and scripts that support machine learning operations:
- `activation_functions.py`: Includes various activation functions used in neural networks.
