Shortcomings of Machine Learning:
1. Statistical model rather than causal.
2. Transparent reasoning and auditable answers.
3. Requirement of clean, complete and accurate training data.
4. Reliance on human data scientists to construct, tune, and refine the statistical models.
5. Inability of siloed one-off models to generalize across domains, functions, business units, or geographies.
